Subject: [PATCH] revise the check for destructor attribute

The check for destructor attribute always fails with the compiler flag
Wstrict-prototypes, as a result libgimpwidgets will never call babl_exit
which is in its destruction and in particular the babl fish cache will
never be constructed.

With this fix the warning and conftest.err in the destrucor test will
not be generated thus babl cache gets enabled. It should improves babl
performance in GIMP, and more notably it cuts GIMP's launch time by
half on my i9 9900K machine.
